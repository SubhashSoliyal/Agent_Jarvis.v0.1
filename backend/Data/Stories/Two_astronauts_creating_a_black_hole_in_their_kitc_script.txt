Captain Nova: Dr. Quasar, I've received a distress call from astronauts, Jack and Alex. They claim to have created a black hole in their kitchen.

Dr. Quasar: A black hole in their kitchen? That's impossible. They must be joking.

Captain Nova: I've spoken to them, and they're dead serious. They say they were experimenting with a new recipe and somehow managed to create a singularity.

Dr. Quasar: A recipe? What kind of recipe could possibly create a black hole?

Captain Nova: Apparently, they were trying to make a cake and accidentally added a zero-point module to the mix.

Dr. Quasar: A zero-point module? That's a highly advanced piece of technology. What were they thinking, using it in a kitchen?

Captain Nova: I don't know, but now they're saying the black hole is growing and threatening to suck up their entire house.

Dr. Quasar: This is a disaster. We need to get a team over there immediately to contain the situation.

Captain Nova: I've already sent a team, but they're having trouble getting close to the house. The gravity from the black hole is warping space-time around it.

Dr. Quasar: We need to come up with a solution, and fast. If that black hole gets any bigger, it could threaten the entire planet.

Captain Nova: I agree. Do you have any ideas, Doctor?

Dr. Quasar: Well, we could try to create a negative mass field to counteract the gravity of the black hole.

Captain Nova: That's a good idea. Let's get to work on it. We don't have much time.

Dr. Quasar: I'll start running the calculations. But Captain, we need to be careful. If we're not careful, we could make the situation worse.

Captain Nova: I understand, Doctor. Let's just hope we can contain this thing before it's too late.
