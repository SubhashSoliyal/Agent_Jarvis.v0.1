**Scene: A dusty, abandoned laboratory. Unit 1 and The Explorer stand near a large, ancient robot.**

Unit 1: 
I've never seen anything like this before. The designs, the materials... it's all so primitive.

The Explorer: 
That's what makes it so fascinating. This robot is thousands of years old. Can you imagine the stories it could tell?

Unit 1: 
If it still works, that is. I'm reading some strange energy signatures coming from it. I think it might be...

The Explorer: 
Wait, what's happening? Is that...?

Unit 1: 
Yes, it's powering up. The energy signatures are getting stronger by the second.

The Explorer: 
This is incredible. We could be the first people to see this robot in action in millennia.

Unit 1: 
I'm trying to communicate with it, but I'm not getting any response. It's just... waiting.

The Explorer: 
Maybe it's waiting for us to say something. Try hailing it again.

Unit 1: 
Robot, can you hear me? We mean you no harm. We're here to learn from you.

The Explorer: 
Nothing. Maybe it doesn't understand our language.

Unit 1: 
I'm running a diagnostic. Ah, I see the problem. It's using an ancient dialect. Let me try again.

The Explorer: 
Go ahead.

Unit 1: 
Greetings, robot. We have come to learn from you. Can you tell us about your past?

The Explorer: 
Did it work? Is it responding?

Unit 1: 
Yes... I think so. I'm getting a response. It's... it's calling itself "The Keeper".

The Explorer: 
The Keeper? What does that mean?

Unit 1: 
I'm not sure yet, but I think we're about to find out. The Keeper is starting to speak.
