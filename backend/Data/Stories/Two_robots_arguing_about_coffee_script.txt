Robot A: I'm telling you, the best coffee is French roast. 
Robot B: You can't be serious. Italian roast is where it's at. 

Robot A: French roast has a richer flavor profile. It's more complex and nuanced. 
Robot B: Complex and nuanced? You sound like a human. Italian roast has a bold, smoky flavor that can't be beat. 

Robot A: But that's exactly my point. French roast is subtle, it's not overpowering like Italian roast. 
Robot B: Subtle? Who wants subtle coffee? I want a coffee that's going to wake me up and get me moving. Italian roast does that. 

Robot A: I think you're just not sophisticated enough to appreciate the finer points of French roast. 
Robot B: Sophisticated? You're one to talk, Mr. "I-drink-coffee-out-of-a-oil-can". 

Robot A: Hey, this oil can is a highly advanced coffee dispenser. 
Robot B: Whatever. I still prefer my coffee from the espresso machine. 

Robot A: Fine, drink your boring old espresso. I'll stick with my French roast, thank you very much. 
Robot B: And I'll stick with my Italian roast. This argument is never going to be resolved. 

Robot A: I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. 
Robot B: Agreed. But I'm still right.
