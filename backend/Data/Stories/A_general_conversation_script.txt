Kajal: Hey Subhash, how's it going? 
Subhash: I'm doing well, thanks for asking. Just got back from a morning walk. How about you?
Kajal: I'm good, just got my morning coffee. I needed it after a long week.
Subhash: I can imagine. So, what are your plans for the weekend?
Kajal: I was thinking of visiting my family. I haven't seen them in a while. How about you?
Subhash: I'm planning to catch up on some reading. I've got a few books pending and I really want to finish them.
Kajal: That sounds like a great plan. I've been meaning to start reading more often. Do you have any book recommendations?
Subhash: Actually, yes. I just finished reading this amazing novel. I think you'd really enjoy it.
Kajal: Really? What's it called?
Subhash: It's called "The Alchemist". Have you heard of it?
Kajal: Yes, I've heard great things about it. I'll have to add it to my list.
Subhash: Definitely do. So, are you going to your family's place for the entire weekend?
Kajal: Yeah, I think so. We're planning to have a big dinner on Sunday and I don't want to miss it.
Subhash: That sounds like fun. Give them my regards, okay?
Kajal: Will do. Hey, it was great catching up with you. We should do it more often.
Subhash: Absolutely. Take care and have a great weekend.
Kajal: You too. Bye.
Subhash: Bye.
