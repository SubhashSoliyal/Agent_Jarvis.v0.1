Subject: Notification of Absence due to Unforeseen Circumstances

Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to come to work today as I have been unexpectedly detained by extraterrestrial beings. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am returned to Earth and able to resume my duties. I appreciate your understanding in this matter and am available to provide any necessary documentation or explanation upon my return.

Thank you for your support and accommodation.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
